## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-git.mp4 -->
https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/assets/24854248/3c2b34cd-f04f-4e30-9ca4-1ff51e2d65a2

**Note**: This demo uses custom `vim.notify()` from [mini.notify](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-notify.md) and diff line number highlighting from [mini.diff](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-diff.md).

## Features

- Automated tracking of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) related data: root path, status, HEAD, etc. Exposes buffer-local variables for convenient use in statusline.

- `:Git` command for executing any `git` call inside file's repository root with deeper current instance integration (show output as notification/buffer, use to edit commit messages, etc.).

- Helper functions to inspect Git history:
    - `MiniGit.show_range_history()` shows how certain line range evolved.
    - `MiniGit.show_diff_source()` shows file state as it was at diff entry.
    - `MiniGit.show_at_cursor()` shows Git related data depending on context.

What it doesn't do:

- Replace fully featured Git client. Rule of thumb: if feature does not rely on a state of current Neovim (opened buffers, etc.), it is out of scope. For more functionality, use either ['mini.diff'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-diff.md) or fully featured Git client.

For more information see these parts of help:

- `:h :Git`
- `:h MiniGit-examples`
- `:h MiniGit.enable()`
- `:h MiniGit.get_buf_data()`

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.git').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- General CLI execution
  job = {
    -- Path to Git executable
    git_executable = 'git',

    -- Timeout (in ms) for each job before force quit
    timeout = 30000,
  },

  -- Options for `:Git` command
  command = {
    -- Default split direction
    split = 'auto',
  },
}
```
