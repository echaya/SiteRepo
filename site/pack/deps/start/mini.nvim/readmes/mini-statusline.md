## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-statusline.mp4 -->

## Features

- Define own custom statusline structure for active and inactive windows. This is done with a function which should return string appropriate for |statusline|. Its code should be similar to default one with structure:
    - Compute string data for every section you want to be displayed.
    - Combine them in groups with `MiniStatusline.combine_groups()`.
- Built-in active mode indicator with colors.
- Sections can hide information when window is too narrow (specific window width is configurable per section).

## Dependencies

For full experience needs (still works without any of suggestions):

- [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and enabled ['mini.icons'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-icons.md) module to show filetype icons. Can fall back to using [nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) plugin.

- Enabled ['mini.git'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-git.md) and ['mini.diff'](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-diff.md) modules to show Git and diff related information. Can fall back to using [lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) plugin.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.statusline').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Content of statusline as functions which return statusline string. See
  -- `:h statusline` and code of default contents (used instead of `nil`).
  content = {
    -- Content for active window
    active = nil,
    -- Content for inactive window(s)
    inactive = nil,
  },

  -- Whether to use icons by default
  use_icons = true,
}
```
